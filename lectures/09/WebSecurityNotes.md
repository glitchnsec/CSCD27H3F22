Challenges of Web Security

- Achieve security across all technology
- Very expressive languages
- weakly verified states,cookies
- url parsing challenges
- file determination polyglot files
- Cross domain interaction
- Use of Caches
- Routing, middleware proxies loadbalancers, caches

- Security and Bypasses
    - Don't trust the user input
    - Browser proactively protecting the user
    - web app specifyfing how the browser behaves on the site

    - Privilege separation
    - Content-Security Policy

    - Client Side certificates
        - revocation
        - managemenr difficutly so slow adoption

- Intermediary defences
    - Proxies
    - Web Application Firewalls
